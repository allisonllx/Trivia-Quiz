# Trivia Quiz

## Setting up
A Firebase account is required to upload players' scores to Firestore database.
Create a .env file containing the following details: `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_EMAIL`, and `VITE_FIREBASE_PASSWORD`. Most of these information can be found in the project settings when you initialise a new project on Firebase.
Run `npm run dev` to launch the quiz web app.
